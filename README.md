Files: Analyzing COVID-19: Can the Data Community Help?

Description:
With the current concerns over SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19, there are now available various COVID-19 datasets on Kaggle and GitHub as well as competitions such as the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) (https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge#). Whether you are a student or a professional data scientist, we thought we could help out by providing a primer session with notebooks on how to start analyzing these datasets.

The dataset used by this iPython notebook is "South Korea COVID-19 Dataset" located in : https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset

In this uncertain time, let's see what we can to make sense of this data and help each other out! And don't forget to wash your hands!
